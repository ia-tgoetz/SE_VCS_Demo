# SE Demo Script

## Part 1 - Create local repo and connect to remote repo

### Create local Git Repo on you dev machine

Open the local folder you want your repo to exist in.
For this demo it will be the directory that you are going to deploy the Docker stack in and persist files.
For anyone not using containerization, it may just be the data directory of an Ignition install.

Create a file in that directory called .gitignore.
the .gitignore file will tell git what files in the directory to "ignore" and not version control.
For this demo, use the following 

Open a terminal at that directory.
Run the following command to create a git repo there:
```
git init .
```

Create a remote remote repo in GitHub

Then run add the remote repo:
```
git remote add origin <Repo URL>
```

### Add to staging and commit to remote repo

Next add the locally tracked files and commit them to the local repo with the following commands:
```
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
```


## Part 2 - Edit a resource and push changes

### Edit resource

Create a resource by:
- Start Ignition gateway (if not started already)
- Open designer
- Create a Perspective view and add a label with whatever text you want in it

In the command line run the following command to view changed files:
```
git status
```
*Note: If using VScode, this is a good time to jump back into that window and show the diffs for the actual files in the source control extension

### Commit resources and push to remote repo

In the command line run the following commands to commit those resources and push to the remote repo:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Added Perspective view"
git push -u origin master
```

To view the localrepo as up to date run the command:
```
git status
```

Open the repo in Github to see your changes reflected there


## Part 3 - Best practices and guidance
### What files to version control?
Take an additive approach. Create the local git repo in a directory that contains the files you care about tracking, and as few other as possible. 
For example, if you only care about projects and no config. Create your local repo on the data/projects directory.
If you want both projects and config items and are using a more advanced deployment method, only persist the data/projects and data/config/resources directories to the host file system. They create the local repo on a folder where both of those are persisted.

### Deployment modes for different environments
If you have the system-properties/config.json file tracked as part of your git repo you will notice that it holds the gateway name.
Where this can cause issues is when the config directory is being tracked for config changes and you want gateways across different environments to use the same remote repo, but have different gateway names. The recommended solution for keeping gateway names unique to each gateway and not having that interfere with the controlled files is to use deployment modes. Create an override for each of your environments and update the name for that environments respective mode.

### Potential Permission issues when persisting both Docker named volumes and bind mounts
As discussed above, it can be beneficial to only track the directories you want with your vcs efforts. However, if you are using a deployment method like Docker and persisting just the projects and/or config directory you may notice that the gateway itself will lose all the local files that make it a unique deployment whenever you re-spin up that gateway. You can persist the entirety of the data directory in a Docker named volume alongside the specific directories that are persisted to the host file system. Doing this can cause potential permission issues, as the container user that is creating the volumes may not have access to create the needed files on the host system. To allow this to run you can start the container with user: 0:0 to run as root. We also recommend supplying the IGNITION_UID and IGNITION_GID for security reasons to run the Ignition service in the container as a specifically created application service account.

## Part 4 - Clone to Prod environment

Move to your production environment

### Add local repo for Prod
####  Option A
Create a local repo and connect to the remote repo:
```
git init .
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin <Repo URL>
git pull
```

#### Option B
If no environment exist yet, create the directory and clone the remote repo with the following command:
```
git clone <repo URL> <Local directory path>
```
Update env file and to match new environment

### Let's see a change all the way through!
#### Add a change to the local dev environment
Go back to the dev system and open the gateway web page.
This time let's add a programmable simulator device that users the Dairy Sim program.
Run the following commands to see what file has changed from our change, and to add and commit it to the local repo:
```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "added a programmable simulator device connection"
```

#### Push the new change to the remote repo
Let's push to the remote repo again with the following commands:
```
git push -u origin master
```
Now you can go to the remote repo and view the changes there if desired

#### Pull the new change to our prod environment
Now back on the prod environment run the following command:
git pull origin master
